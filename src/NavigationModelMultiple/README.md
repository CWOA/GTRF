# Work title

This repository provides a framework for rapidly prototyping, verifying and evaluating algorithmic approaches to the problem of distributed target recovery.

This repository accompanies the IROS 2018 submission entitled *"Learning to Search for Distributed Targets from UAV-like Vision"*.
All source code used to generate results and data within the submission is given here for public use, further work and transparency.
